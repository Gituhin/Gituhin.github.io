Hey 👋🏻 there! I am Tuhin. Welcome to my homepage

**About Me**

I am a first year master's student in artificial intelligence at Northeastern University, Boston Campus. I am interested in interpreting deep learning and vision models through weight spaces.

I graduated from IIT Kharagpur, India in 2024 with a dual-degree (B.Tech and M.Tech) in civil engineering and micro-specialization in artificial intelligence and applications.
